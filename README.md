# 🐧 **Introduction**

This repository contains a collection of **Bash automation scripts** created as part of my *Red Hat System Administration (RH124 & RH134)* training.

These scripts demonstrate practical, real-world skills in **Linux system administration**, covering:

- **Process monitoring**
- **USB event detection**
- **User session logging**
- **Dynamic MOTD generation**
- **Idle session detection and termination**
- **System auditing & automation**

Each script highlights essential SysAdmin concepts such as:

- *Shell scripting*  
- *Cron-based automation*  
- *System logging & log rotation awareness*  
- *User & process management*  
- *Security-oriented monitoring*  

The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on, functional tools that reflect core competencies required in system administration while showcasing my progress throughout the Red Hat training modules.
