🐧 Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Bash automation scripts created as part of my Red Hat System Administration (RH124 & RH134) training.
These scripts focus on real-world Linux system administration tasks such as process monitoring, USB event tracking, user session logging, MOTD automation, and idle-session management.

Each script is designed to demonstrate core SysAdmin skills including:

Shell scripting

System automation

Log management

Cron job scheduling

Process and session handling

Security and auditing practices

The goal of this project is to showcase practical Linux administration capabilities while building tools that can assist in everyday system maintenance, monitoring, and automation.
